<title>Our mission</title>
<h1>What we do</h1>
Our mission is to rid the world of furries. not all. we actually dont care about the normal animal cosplayers. We care about the furries who are this:
<p>* Likes kids</p>
<p>* Engages in drawing or animating p****graphy</p>
<p>* Over-s**ualises kids or animals</p>
<p>* Mostly weird in a very bad way</p>
<p>Yes, we only care about those.</p>
<p>But why do we target those kinds of furries? Well, this is an article. So, for example, we dont target that 85% of furries that aren't totally weird in a bad way, we target that 15%, who are so weird and bad, some need jail time.</p>
<p>Now you know.</p>
